## TODO
2. cleanup/refactor everything
*. remove this todo list

## Idea
Idea original! 

## Tools
1. create-react-app <3
2. Material UI - header, footer & icons
3. User Agent Info: @oieduardorabelo/use-user-agent
 
## APIs
1. user IP address: https://geolocation-db.com/
2. user city information: https://apiip.net/
3. Map: https://developers.google.com/maps

## Learning
1. Again: the most APIs I've used in an app

## Future Directions
If I were to spend anymore time on this app:
1. more compartmentalization-- especially seperating API logic/data from display 
2. more data: ideally, this would be built out to something far more 'creepy' in terms
of the data we can git from only a user's IP-- as is, it's doesn't have much shock value

## Hire me
I'm really just tryna get hired. Hit me up:
