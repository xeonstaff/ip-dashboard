## TODO
1. hide all API keys-- incl index.html
2. cleanup/refactor everything
*. remove this todo list

## Idea
Idea original! 

## Tools

## APIs
1. user IP address: https://geolocation-db.com/
2. user city information: https://apiip.net/


## Learning
1. Again: the most APIs I've used in an app

## Future Directions
If I were to spend anymore time on this app:
1. more compartmentalization-- especially seperating API logic/data from display 

## Hire me
I'm really just tryna get hired. Hit me up:
